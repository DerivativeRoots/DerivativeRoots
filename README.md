This Jupyter notebook presents a Python code for an algorithm that finds all the real roots of a polynomial, using the roots of its derivative to obtain isolating intervals. Roots of the derivative are found by recursive applications of the method, until a first degree polynomial is found. 
We present arbitrary precision mpmath Python code for the algorithm, tests with notorious polynomials, and auxiliary functions including a test for the number of real roots based on Sturm's theorem.

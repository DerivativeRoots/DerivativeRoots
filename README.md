# Finding polynomial roots through recursive derivative search

This notebook is an attempt at creating a method to find derivatives of polynomials using a binary search method with limits defined by recursive derivatives.

The method is better described in the notebook, and is, as far as we know, not known and not taught, even though it's extremely simple to understand and describe.

﻿﻿﻿﻿This repository contains Python code for the  algorithm [described here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320864673_A_simple_algorithm_to_find_all_real_roots_of_a_polynomial) that finds all the real roots of a polynomial, using the roots of its derivative to obtain ranges with isolated roots. The roots of the derivative are found by recursive applications of the method. Recursion stops when a first-degree polynomial is found. The algorithm also finds the multiplicity of each root.There are three notebooks: - one that uses standard floating point, - another that is a verbose version of the first one,- and another uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic, using mpmath. Each notebook presents tests with notorious polynomials and auxiliary functions, including a test for the number of real roots based on Sturm's theorem.
